A small, fun game project, used as an introduction into the world of game development. The program takes as and argument the map file that needs to be located in the Maps folder and has to have the .ber format. The program draws the map dinamically, and the objective of the game is for the monster to eat all the cake pieces on the map and then escape trough the portal. The project has a very good map checking function that checks the validity of the map and prints custom error messages depending of the missing characteristic of the map. Basically everytime a key is pressed the position of the player on the map is changed, and the colectible is being removed, then the map is being rebuilt all over again, giving us the cool impresion of movement. As always run the make command for the compilation of the program. Enjoy! :)
